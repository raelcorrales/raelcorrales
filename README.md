### Hi, I'm Rael: Data Jedi Master...*but seriously, Data Engineer*

Hey there! 🌟 I'm Juan Rael, a data engineer at TCS who thrives on wrangling data with Python, NodeJS, and the power of the cloud *(AWS & GCP, you name it!)*. ☁️

#### In a Nutshell:
- I build APIs that talk to data like it's their BFF.
- I craft pipelines for AI projects that are smarter than the average bear.
- I'm a serverless and CI/CD champion, making deployments smoother than butter.

#### Skills that Pay the Bills (and Fuel My Coffee Addiction):
- **Programming Languages**: Python (my main squeeze), NodeJS, SQL *(all flavors!)*, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (Lambda, SNS) & GCP (Dataflow, BigQuery, Bigtable) - I speak fluent cloud!
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Django *(backend buddies)*, Apache Beam, Express
- **Tools & Technologies**: Terraform, Kubernetes *(orchestration extraordinaire!)*, Helm, Selenium *(testing the life out of things!)*, Generative AI *(the future is here!)*
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab - *version control is my jam!*

#### Battle Scars (aka Experience Highlights):
- **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS):** Built APIs, optimized pipelines for NLP projects, and powered AI with smarter datasets.
- **Coppel:** Migrated data to the cloud (GCP BigQuery, baby!), improved scalability by 60%, and automated deployments with CI/CD.
- **Alliance IT LLC:** Created serverless applications and microservices for real-time solutions. Automated configuration management with Ansible and Jinja2.

#### Current Quests (aka Goals):
- Conquering the GitHub Foundations Certification *(prepare to be amazed by my Git skills!)*
- Leveling up in **MLOps/AIOps** and becoming a **Data Architect** extraordinaire.

#### Side Hustles (aka Projects):
- **Maintenance Scheduler**: An API for generating maintenance schedules with Python and AWS *(because who wants to do that manually?)*.
- **Enterprise Search Engine**: Designed a data ingestion pipeline that integrates with Elasticsearch *(search anything, instantly!)*.

#### Education & Brain Sharpening:
- **Bachelor's Degree**: Computer Science Engineering - Instituto Tecnológico Superior de Puerto Vallarta *(knowledge is power!)*
- **Master's Degree**: Business Administration *(in progress)* - because well-roundedness is key!

#### When I'm Not Wrangling Data:
- Experimenting with **Generative AI** *(the future is here, I told you!)*.
- Deep diving into all things data engineering *(because you can never learn enough!)*.
- Exploring the cloud *(because it's a vast and exciting landscape!)*.
